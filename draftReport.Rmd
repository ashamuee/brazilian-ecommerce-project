Clustering:

Some customers didn't write a review. But why are they happy or mad?

Sales Prediction:

With purchase date information you'll be able to predict future sales.

Delivery Performance:

You will also be able to work through delivery performance and find ways to optimize delivery times.

Product Quality: (Let's see if we can find this)

Enjoy yourself discovering the products categories that are more prone to customer insatisfaction.

Attention

- An order might have multiple items.
- Each item might be fulfilled by a distinct seller.
- All text identifying stores and partners where replaced by the names of Game of Thrones great houses.

olist_customers_dataset.csv
This dataset has information about the customer and its location. Use it to identify unique customers in the orders dataset and to find the orders delivery location.
At our system each order is assigned to a unique customerid. This means that the same customer will get different ids for different orders. The purpose of having a customerunique_id on the dataset is to allow you to identify customers that made repurchases at the store. Otherwise you would find that each order had a different customer associated with.

olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv
This dataset includes data about the reviews made by the customers.

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.


olist_orders_dataset.csv
This is the core dataset. From each order you might find all other information.

olist_products_dataset.csv
Products Dataset
This dataset includes data about the products sold by Olist.


# Overview
Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

# Analysis

Product Quality: (Let's see if we can find this)

Trying to identify the products categories that are more prone to customer insatisfaction. Some things come to mind
- categories with more poorly rated products? data set--> order_reviews_dataset
- categories which tend to be delivered late? data set-->
- expensive products maybe? do not get value for money?
- bulky products maybe?
- some categories maybe limited to few sellers and they may not be selling good products?


Likely classification problem that you select category and given paramters should it come undder customer satisfaction or not.
Anything less than 3 is unsatisfied
3 or more is satisfied

but for same product you may have some people satisfied and some as not. 
( I think that's where knn and related algorithms were introduced, to find mean of the points)

Would be good clustering project but may not be ideal as it based on unsupervised learning and its  coverage was limited.

Maybe it would be wiser to look at sales or delivery times problems.



Clustering:

So given order of an item, delivery time, product etc  can we try to predict customer rating. But will be so miliar to movielens project can become boring



Delivery Performance:

You will also be able to work through delivery performance and find ways to optimize delivery times.

Let's predict delivery time/date
-- delivery distance
-- location of customer as some can be remotely connected and need special delivery merchanism. This is independent of delivery distance.
-- location of seller as shipping from some locations maybe difficult. This is independent of delivery distance.
-- size of product? 
-- price of product (expensive nature of product as it could mean extra care or it maybe fragile?)
-- purchase time....if in night, delivery time maybe longer
-- order approved at time-> if payment approval came multiple hours after purchase time, this maybe longer
-- product category -- products of same category may show similar behavior.
-- or specific product - some products may have higher delivery time.
-- deliveries maybe impacted due to sales, festival season.

we should consider if we need time stamp or we can take purchase time as 0 and calculated approved at from it. though we may lose granularity in terms of time as truck may come everyday at 4. so after 4 you can ship , before 4 you cant


estimated delivery date is present in ---> order_estimated_delivery_date
We can calculate RMSE using that and it will be our benchmark

We can see if we improved than that or not. It will give us indication of how close are we to the production model RMSE.

# The Postal Code Address (CEP) is an eight-digit number set that has by main objective to guide and accelerate the distribution of objects sent through the national mail in Brazil. The current structure of the Brazilian postal code is 8 (eight) digits, divided into two parts:

# first part composed of 5 digits where each digit represents the 1) region, 2) sub-region, 3) sector, 4) subsector, 5) subsector divider;
# the second part is composed of 3 digits, separated by a hyphen from the first part and represents the Distribution Identifiers.
# You can navigate through states, then cities and finally neighborhoods and streets until you find the corresponding postal code.

cor(wrangled_data$price,wrangled_data$number_of_hours)
```
Price Group for a product does not give any clear indication. It does not seem to be impacting delivery time of product.


```{r Explore distance relationship between two points with number_of_hours}
# let's plot errorbar for number of hours vs distance group
# we can see a pattern that as distance increases delivery time increases. 
wrangled_data %>% mutate(distance_group=round(distance_between_two_points/50)+1) %>% mutate(distance_group=as.factor(distance_group)) %>% group_by(distance_group) %>% summarise(mean=mean(number_of_hours),se=sd(number_of_hours)/sqrt(n())) %>% ggplot(aes(x=distance_group,y=mean,ymax=mean+2*se,ymin=mean-2*se)) + geom_point()+geom_errorbar() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))

cor(wrangled_data$distance_between_two_points,wrangled_data$number_of_hours)
```

Distance Group can be seen to influence delivery time.


```{r Explore freight value group with number_of_hours}
# let's plot errorbar for number of hours vs freight value group
wrangled_data %>% mutate(freight_value_group=round(freight_value/5)+1) %>% mutate(freight_value_group=as.factor(freight_value_group)) %>% group_by(freight_value_group) %>% summarise(mean=mean(number_of_hours),se=sd(number_of_hours)/sqrt(n())) %>% ggplot(aes(x=freight_value_group,y=mean,ymax=mean+2*se,ymin=mean-2*se)) + geom_point()+geom_errorbar() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))

cor(wrangled_data$freight_value,wrangled_data$number_of_hours)
```

Above graphs indicates that for freight value group where each group represents 5 units, as freight value increases, number of hours for delivery increases.

validation_dataset <- wrangled_data[test_indices,]
#TODO ensure validation_dataset has products only for concerned product categories which are in training_dataset 
```


We use training_dataset and split into into train and test set. So that training_dataset is sufficient to fine tune the model
```{r Split data for training}
# Let's split training_dataset into two parts
set.seed(1,sample.kind = 'Rounding')
test_indices <- createDataPartition(training_dataset$number_of_hours,times=1,p=0.2,list=FALSE)

train_subset <- training_dataset[-test_indices,]
test_subset <- training_dataset[test_indices,]
#TODO ensure test_subset has products only for concerned product categories which are in train_subset 
```

```{r Linear model}
# trying to reduce coefficients.
# in dimensions we can use volume to decrase predictors

To improve model performance consider--> changing character categorical variables to numerical categorical variables like
  
  product_category_name=as.factor(as.numeric(product_category_name)) 

use levels from original data for completeness

look for variables which have limited to no results and we can combine them as one categorical variable
Refer: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/11/easy-methods-deal-categorical-variables-predictive-modeling/
Also read : feature hashing

Existing model algorithms should handle regularization. So we should not be required to handle ourselves.


We can use conditional model i.e. for some use different model and for some use different model just like ensemble.
So basically we could say for these pin codes, delivery time= say mean of delivery time and for others use standard algorthm like random forest etc.



# Results
# Conclusion
We can make fine predictions if we can predict time for approval, time for handling of goods to carrier and time for delivery separately as final prediction would be based on that.
But when a new order is made, we only know purchase time

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
