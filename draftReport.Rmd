olist_customers_dataset.csv
This dataset has information about the customer and its location. Use it to identify unique customers in the orders dataset and to find the orders delivery location.
At our system each order is assigned to a unique customerid. This means that the same customer will get different ids for different orders. The purpose of having a customerunique_id on the dataset is to allow you to identify customers that made repurchases at the store. Otherwise you would find that each order had a different customer associated with.

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
